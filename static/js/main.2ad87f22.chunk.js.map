These members are\r\n            committed to the three \"Evangelical Counsels\". They aim to live in a\r\n            level of poverty not amassing significant personal wealth, obedience\r\n            to one's legitimate superiors, and chastity. More than anything\r\n            these individuals seek to be a part of a group that have a clear and\r\n            defined orientation, purpose, and ideology within the Church.

All require that they take\r\n            vows to the Evangelical Counsels, but they can also take vows\r\n            adhering to fidelity of the monastic way of life which may include\r\n            chastity, poverty, commitment to remain in the same monastery for\r\n            the rest of their life, and obedience to the abbot or group rules.\r\n            Joining\r\n           \r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            The first thing you need to know is what Discernment means:\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <div className='t1'>Discernment:</div>\r\n            1. the ability to judge well.\r\n            <br />\r\n            2.

It's the\r\n            pondering and making of the decision to enter the priesthood. Under\r\n            the Arch Diocese of Boston a \"Discernment guide\" <sup>\r\n              Source 5\r\n            </sup>{' '}\r\n            has been created. This has the goal of helping people understand\r\n            whether or not they wish to go into the priesthood.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 1: understanding happiness Give up my idea of what will make me\r\n            happy Seek to do the fathers will\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 2: Created for a Purpose You have a purpose, you are totally\r\n            unique. Jesus loves you so much that he invites you to help him save\r\n            the world….. The first step in discerning your vocation is to\r\n            understand that God has created you out of love and in his love\r\n            invites you to share in his work of saving the world\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 3: His will is best\r\n            <br />\r\n            By accepting this step you are submitting your life to the grace of\r\n            God.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 4:Listen\r\n            <br />\r\n            Learn to listen to the voice of God, block out some of the noise\r\n            from our already incredibly immersive life and take a step back. In\r\n            this way we see a similar discussion to that of rejecting the\r\n            physical world as is done by Buddhist monks, but in a different\r\n            sense. Catholicism doesn't outright condemn these things, however in\r\n            order to pursue the priesthood one must learn to block out some of\r\n            the world's more earthly distractions.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 5: Rid Life of Obstacles\r\n            <br />\r\n            This means overcoming the past, fear, and the worldy guilt that comes from sin.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 6: Give Everything\r\n            <br />\r\n            This next step is about responding to that love Jesus gives us and\r\n            all that we are. Give yourself entirely to Jesus, and build up your\r\n            personal relationship with him. In this step the use of the\r\n            Sacraments, Prayer, and Virtues are discussed to help find depth in\r\n            a relationship with Jesus. They end touching upon Asceticism, or as\r\n            the church defines it \"Making Sacrifices\" in order to fully embrace\r\n            Jesus's love.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Step 7:Know His voice\r\n            <br />\r\n            This one is interesting. According to the Arch-Diocese of Boston we\r\n            see a discussion of 4 different voices. The voice of God, The self,\r\n            The Devil, and The World. Properly understanding these voices that\r\n            occur around and within us is important to becoming a priest,\r\n            developing a secure sense of self, and a secure relationship with\r\n            Jesus.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            \r\n            <div className=\"t1\">Monastic groups:</div> Joining one of the groups of the\r\n            institute of Consecrated life can take many years.

Many people decide to leave from there,\r\n            choosing to find a calling elsewhere. If they are indeed accepted\r\n            then a trial period will commence before they can continue further.\r\n            This usually lasts from one to two years. During this they can take\r\n            temporary vows, further committing themselves into their respected\r\n            institute.

Interview at a seminary After\r\n            completing the Application for Sponsorship, the Archdiocese will\r\n            make a decision regarding your application, and when a positive\r\n            decision is made, you will be presented to a seminary for interview\r\n            and acceptance into their seminary formation program.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            The interview at the seminary usually involves meeting with several\r\n            members of the seminary faculty, either in a group or individual\r\n            interview to discuss your desire to discern and be formed in the\r\n            seminary. While it is not simply a “rubber stamp”, it is not common\r\n            for a man to be recommended by the Archdiocese and then not be\r\n            admitted to a particular seminary.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Next are formation programs, there are three formation programs\r\n            available to men who desire to discern and prepare for the diocesan\r\n            priesthood<sup>Source 4</sup>.

After the bishop speaks upon the\r\n          various forms of ministry exercised within the church he will state\r\n          that the priests are those who assisted the apostles in making Christ\r\n          present in the Church today.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Explanatory Rites</h2>\r\n        <p> The Rites that follow are explanatory Rites:</p>\r\n        <h3>Investiture with Stole and Chasuble</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The newly ordained priests stay standing, and are vested with the\r\n          stole and chasuble as symbolic representation of their new power and\r\n          office in the church.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Anointing of Hands</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The newly ordained priests have their hands anointed with \"sacred\r\n          chrism\". This symbolizes the power granted before them to perform the\r\n          Eucharist, changing bread into the Body of Christ and wine into the\r\n          Blood of Christ.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Presentation of Bread and Wine</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The ordaining bishop shall then receive gifts of bread and wine from\r\n          the laity celebrating mass. Once the chalice and paten have been\r\n          prepared, it is presented to the bishop, who then presents it to the\r\n          new priests as they kneel before him.{' '}\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Kiss of Peace</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The bishop leading the ordination ceremony gives a fraternal kiss that\r\n          is also known as the sign of peace to each of the new priests. The\r\n          attending priests also follow suit. This gesture specifically is a\r\n          sign of welcome into the Priesthood of the Catholic Church, which they\r\n          all share duty in as brothers.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <div className='wrapperCenter'>\r\n          <h3>Liturgy of Eucharist</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='wrapperCenter'>\r\n          <img src={eucharist} alt='Layingofhands' className='img2' />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='wrapperCenter'>\r\n          <br />\r\n          <sup>Eucharist being given to the Laity.

It's a time of\r\n          celebration and great reverence, as the priests give their first\r\n          Eucharist with their audience of Ordination.{' '}\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className='center'>\r\n          If you are interested here is a full ordination ceremony that was\r\n          performed in 2016 by the Archdiocese of Washington:\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <div className='center'>\r\n          <ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au6uOPf-DcY' />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <br />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Symbolism;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Sources extends Component {\r\n    //H2 is our bigger text block, title style\r\n            //More than likely will be the \"title\" of any such source used\r\n\r\n    // p will be our body text to anything that goes on.\r\n            //Informationon how to find the source, and other information regarding how to access such things will be listed here.\r\n\r\n        \r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h1 class=\"center\">Sources</h1>\r\n      \r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default Sources;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\n//Note: need some proper css in regards to formatting paragraphs.
